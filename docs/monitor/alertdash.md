# Alerts Dashboard

The Alerts Dashboard shows the list of currently Open Alerts along with Resolved or Closed Alerts for the current day or for other historical time periods.

Each Alert shown can be further analyzed using drilldown options.

If an alert definition has _Manual Resolution_ option set, users can _manually_ resolve an open alert using the UI, by 
clicking on the _Set As Resolved_ button on expanding the Alert.

Users can also set Open Alerts as `Acknowledged` by clicking on the _Acknowledge Alert_ button providing optional Acknowledgement notes.
Once an Open Alert has been acknowledged, _Repeat_ Alerts will not be fired for that Alert.

Refer to [Alerts Guide](../alerts/alertoverview) for further information on Alerts.
