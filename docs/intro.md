# Introduction

***Gyeeta*** is a non intrusive, *100% Open Source (GPLv3)* and *Free* Infrastructure, Services and Process Level monitor (*Linux* only).  

## Salient Features

- Monitor Hosts, Services, Processes at *Global* scale (scales to *tens of thousands* of hosts).
- Completely Open Source including Agent and Server components. Free to use *forever*.
- Completely non-intrusive monitoring using a combination of [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) and Kernel Statistics.
- All Data In-House (On Prem). No external data transfer. 
- Monitor Kubernetes and other Cloud Native Cluster orchestrators.

## Key Monitoring Capabilities

1. Query Global Aggregated Statistics from multiple servers using Web UI or REST APIs.
2. Self Learning Algorithms that can detect Anomalies, Contention or Degradation without any manual inputs. 
3. Advanced Cluster, Service or Process Level Alerts.
4. Service Level Statistics such as Queries/sec, Response Times (Latency) and HTTP Errors (if HTTP based) with no manual inputs or integrations.
   Monitors binary / proprietary network protocol or non HTTP Service statistics as well.
5. Detect Process Level *CPU starvation, Virtual Memory or IO Bottlenecks*. 
6. Monitors all applications without any instrumentation or tapping irrespective of the programming language used.
6. Auto Detect Service Dependencies and Service Network Flows (Service Maps).
