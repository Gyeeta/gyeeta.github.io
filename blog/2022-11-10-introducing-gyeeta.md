We (the team @ Exact Solutions, Inc.)  are very happy to introduce [Gyeeta](https://github.com/gyeeta) to help with 
meeting your organization's Observability and Monitoring needs.

We felt the need for Gyeeta for the following reasons :

- Few tools exist currently in the Free and Open source space which can be quickly deployed.
  Tools such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and [Opentracing](https://opentracing.io)
  exist, but require the applications to expose their metrics using exporters or require 
  specific Application stacks.

- Commercial SaaS tools exist which utilize a combination of APM, Tracing, Kernel Monitors, eBPF
  to provide a rich variety of metrics but these products are expensive both in terms of costs as
  well as Host CPU, Memory and IO usage.

We felt there was the need for a product which was Free, Open source and which organizations could
use to monitor their Infrastructure 24x7 non-intrusively and without any application changes.

This requires a tool which would be very lightweight in terms of resource usage and importantly,
provide quick Alerts or Search results to detect any anomaly or degradation.

We hope you try Gyeeta in your environment and find it a useful product.
