Monitors binary / proprietary network protocol or non HTTP Service statistics as well.\\n- Service Maps, Process and Host level Network Flows with info on all Services and Processes.\\n- Detection of Host and Process Level CPU starvation, Virtual Memory or IO Bottlenecks. \\n- Monitor all applications without any instrumentation or tapping irrespective of the programming language used.\\n- Self Learning Algorithms that can detect Anomalies, Contention or Degradation without any manual inputs. \\n- Advanced Cluster, Service or Process Level Alerts using a powerful Web UI or REST APIs.\\n- All Data In-House (On Prem). Not a SaaS tool. \\n- All Linux Kernels released since 2016 supported (Linux Kernels v4.4.x or higher).\\n\\nGyeeta is optimized (C++ based) for minimal CPU and Memory requirements. \\n\\nWe felt there was a need for a product like Gyeeta for the following reasons :\\n\\n- Few tools exist currently in the Free and Open source Observability space which can be quickly deployed\\n  without application changes and without any manual configuration.\\n\\n- Commercial SaaS tools exist which utilize a combination of APM, Tracing, Kernel Monitors, eBPF\\n  to provide a rich variety of metrics but these products are expensive both in terms of costs as\\n  well as Host CPU, Memory and IO usage and require manual configuration in many cases as well.\\n\\nWe hope you try Gyeeta in your environment and find it a useful tool.\\n\\n**Some snapshots of Gyeeta Web UI :**\\n\\n![Service State Monitor](/img/servicemon.png)\\n\\n![Process Network Flow Dashboard](/img/procflow.png)\\n\\n![Process States](/img/procstate1.png)\\n\\n\\n**Important links related to Gyeeta :**\\n\\nWebsite : [https://gyeeta.io](https://gyeeta.io)\\n\\nGithub Source : [https://github.com/Gyeeta/gyeeta](https://github.com/Gyeeta/gyeeta)\\n\\nDocumentation : [https://gyeeta.io/docs](https://gyeeta.io/docs)\\n\\nLive Web UI Demo : [Live Demo](https://gyeeta.io/docs/livedemo)\\n\\nYoutube Channel : [Gyeeta on Youtube](https://youtube.com/@gyeeta)"}]}')}}]);
